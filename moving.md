Above are all the different pieces or Tetrominos that you will see in a game. For the way I like to play pieces can be moved in three ways.<br>
90° right, 90° left, or 180°.<br>
Knowing how each piece will rotate will allow you to pull off the legendary t-spin, and the less known L-spin.
Once you have gotten familiar with how the pieces move you can check out a guide like [this](https://harddrop.com/wiki/Kaidan_Setups).<br>
(Note that this guide is for 40 clear but the linked guide is mostly for battle tetris, more on that later)
