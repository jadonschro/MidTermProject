# Creating an effecient stack.
**A stack (as pictured below) is just how you stack up your Tetrominos.**<br>

**Why does this matter?**<br>
A good stack will make sure you always have a place to put your pieces and you can reduce the height of the stack quicky.
Idealy this means having a flat top and making sure you have a single column open on the right.<br>
You want your single coloumn on the right for two reasons<br>
1) Being able to drop a Tetris is only possible with an single open column using an I peice.<br>
2) If you learned how peices rotate you should know that having the file open on the right will more easily allow your I piece to turn if your stack is very high.
